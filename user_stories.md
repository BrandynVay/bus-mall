* Images displayed side by side
* Images are randomly placed in the three spots
* User can pick up to 25 before results are displayed.

##Marketing Research

* We want to know what products to put in our catalog
* We want to know what items people want to see in the catalog so we need a way to ask them what they want to buy.
* Limit the amount of times they can click to 25.
* Need to be able to calculate the total of views and calculate the amounts of clicks on a image.
* Display results after 25 clicks.
